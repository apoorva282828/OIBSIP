            <h2>About Stephen Hawking...</h2><br>
            <p>Stephen William Hawking, CH, CBE, FRS, FRSA(8 January 1942 - 14 March 2018) was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author who was director of researcher at the Centre  for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge.
                Between 1979 and 2009, he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, widely viewed as one of the most prestigious academic posts in the world. 
            </p> <br>    
            <p>Hawking studied physics at University College, Oxford (B.A., 1962), and Trinity Hall, Cambridge (Ph.D., 1966). He was elected a research fellow at Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge. 
                In the early 1960s Hawking contracted amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, an incurable degenerative neuromuscular disease. 
                He continued to work despite the disease's progressively disabling effects. 
            </p> <br>
            <p>Hawking worked primarily in the field of general relativity and particularly on the physics of black holes. 
                In 1971 he suggested the formation, following the big bang, of numerous objects containing as much as one billion tons of mass but occupying only the space of a proton. 
                These objects, called mini black holes, are unique in that their immense mass and gravity require that they be ruled by the laws of relativity, while their minute size requires that the laws of quantum mechanics apply to them also. 
            </p><br>
            <p>In 1974 Hawking proposed that, in accordance with the predictions of quantum theory, black holes emit subatomic particles until they exhaust their energy and finally explode. 
                Hawking's work greatly spurred efforts to theoretically delineate the properties of black holes, objects about which it was previously thought that nothing could be known. His work was also important because it showed these properties' relationship to the laws of classical thermodynamics and quantum mechanics.
                Hawking's contributions to physics earned him many exceptional honours. 
            </p> <br>
            <p>In 1974 the Royal Society elected him one of its youngest fellows. 
                He became professor of gravitational physics at Cambridge in 1977, and in 1979 he was appointed to Cambridge's Lucasian professorship of mathematics, a post once held by Isaac Newton. 
                Hawking was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1982 and a Companion of Honour in 1989. 
                He also received the Copley Medal from the Royal Society in 2006 and the U.S. 
                Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009. 
            </p> <br>
            <p>In 2008 he accepted a visiting research chair at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.
                His publications included The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time (1973; coauthored with G.F.R. Ellis), Superspace and Supergravity (1981), The Very Early Universe (1983), and the best sellers A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes (1988), The Universe in a Nutshell (2001), A Briefer History of Time (2005), and The Grand Design (2010; coauthored with Leonard Mlodinow).
